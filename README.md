**The Somber Isles** 
==================
> ### *The Orafus Brothers*
----------------------------

 Whenever I watch the skies settle, the days and nights passed by. A breeze sweeps over the blooming tulips, the trees swing and the birds glide across the sky as the night crawl over the horizon. My hopes diminished when they took over this place. The city was once full of faith and confidence. It was rich, and plentiful of resources and the townsfolks were energetic and full of joy back then. 

It all started many years ago, when our city was ambushed by an unknown military force. They seperated our families, they occupied our land, they stole our treasures, They tortured us to our weakest corner, until we can't resist their powerful new nation, they call themselves, **The Greed**.

We were weak, poor and in need of protection. We can't defend ourselves. Many of us died to the torturing and inequality that they made us suffer. We lack resources to live, to make our own habitats. Even if we did, we would have been crushed down again and again.

Recently, we've been improving our battling and camoflaging skills. It makes us better and stronger. We are able to construct some hideouts and outposts for our people to live. I've been living in a small cave beside the **Camartan Outpost**, I tried salvaging and collecting resources from them. I spent most of my time inventing useful tools to maintain in this corrupted world. Most of the citizens of the **Camartan Outpost** are admired with my handy gadgets.
Some of my gadgets were abducted, obviously by the **The Greed**. Luckily, I still have the blueprints. I should start to thinking about escaping this place. 

The **Somber Isles** awaits for my departure.
