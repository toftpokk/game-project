> ### *The Orafus Brothers*

        Whenever I watch the skies settle, the days and nights passed by. A breeze sweeps over my blooming tulips, the trees swing and the birds glide across the sky as the night crawls over the horizon. My hopes diminished when they took over this place. The city was once full of faith and confidence. It was rich, and plentiful of resources. The townsfolks were energetic and full of joy.
